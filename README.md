# pathFindingSerenity
Simple pathfinding system

This system isn’t efficient or performant.
My goal is to use it on a server with many NPCs that will travel long distances.
If you find any bugs or optimization opportunities, please open an issue or contact me on Discord (yPerfectBR).

There are also a few pending improvements — like making the jumping smoother and more natural, as shown in the video.
I’m open to suggestions, improvements, and any kind of contribution.

This project isn’t meant to be used as a plugin — just copy the class and paste it into your own project.
That said, thanks for using it and for any contributions!
